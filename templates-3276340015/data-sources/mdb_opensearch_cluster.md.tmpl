# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Get information about a Yandex Managed OpenSearch cluster. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://yandex.cloud/docs/managed-opensearch/concepts).

## Example usage

{{ tffile "examples/mdb_opensearch_cluster/d_mdb_opensearch_cluster_1.tf" }}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `cluster_id` - (Optional) The ID of the OpenSearch cluster.

* `name` - (Optional) The name of the OpenSearch cluster.

~> Either `cluster_id` or `name` should be specified.

* `folder_id` - (Optional) The ID of the folder that the resource belongs to. If it is not provided, the default provider folder is used.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:
