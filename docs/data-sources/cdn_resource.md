# yandex_cdn_resource (Data Source)

Get information about a [Yandex Cloud CDN Resource](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cdn/concepts/resource).

~> **Note:** CDN provider must be activated prior usage of CDN resources, either via UI console or via yc cli command: `yc cdn provider activate --folder-id <folder-id> --type gcore`.

~> **Note:** Yandex Cloud CDN supports multiple CDN providers: Yandex Cloud CDN (based on Yandex own technology, used by default) and EdgeCDN (based on EdgeCenter infrastructure). The provider type can be retrieved via the `provider_type` attribute.

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Get information about existing CDN Resource
//
data "yandex_cdn_resource" "my_resource" {
  resource_id = "some resource id"
}

output "resource_cname" {
  value = data.yandex_cdn_resource.my_resource.cname
}
```
