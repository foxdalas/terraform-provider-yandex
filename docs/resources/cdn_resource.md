# yandex_cdn_resource (Resource)

Allows management of [Yandex Cloud CDN Resource](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cdn/concepts/resource).

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new CDN Resource
//
resource "yandex_cdn_resource" "my_resource" {
  cname               = "cdn1.yandex-example.ru"
  active              = false
  origin_protocol     = "https"
  secondary_hostnames = ["cdn-example-1.yandex.ru", "cdn-example-2.yandex.ru"]
  origin_group_id     = yandex_cdn_origin_group.foo_cdn_group_by_id.id

  options {
    edge_cache_settings = 345600
    ignore_cookie       = true
    static_request_headers = {
      is-from-cdn = "yes"
    }
    static_response_headers = {
      is-cdn = "yes"
    }
  }
}
```

### Nested Schema for `options`

Optional:

- `allowed_http_methods` (List of String) HTTP methods for your CDN content. By default the following methods are allowed: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS. In case some methods are not allowed to the user, they will get the 405 (Method Not Allowed) response. If the method is not supported, the user gets the 501 (Not Implemented) response.
- `browser_cache_settings` (Block List) Set up a cache period for the end-users browser. Content will be cached due to origin settings. If there are no cache settings on your origin, the content will not be cached. The list of HTTP response codes that can be cached in browsers: 200, 201, 204, 206, 301, 302, 303, 304, 307, 308. Other response codes will not be cached. The default value is 4 days. **By default, browser caching is enabled in Yandex CDN.** To explicitly disable it, set `enabled = false`. To remove the configuration entirely, omit this block. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--options--browser_cache_settings))
- `cache_http_headers` (List of String) List HTTP headers that must be included in responses to clients.
- `cors` (List of String) Parameter that lets browsers get access to selected resources from a domain different to a domain from which the request is received.
- `custom_host_header` (String) Custom value for the Host header. Your server must be able to process requests with the chosen header.
- `custom_server_name` (String) Wildcard additional CNAME. If a resource has a wildcard additional CNAME, you can use your own certificate for content delivery via HTTPS.
- `disable_proxy_force_ranges` (Boolean) Disabling proxy force ranges.
- `edge_cache_settings` (Block List) Content will be cached according to origin cache settings. Use either `default_value` for simple caching or `custom_values` for per-HTTP-code caching. The value applies for response codes 200, 201, 204, 206, 301, 302, 303, 304, 307, 308 if origin server does not have caching HTTP headers. **By default, edge caching is enabled in Yandex CDN.** To explicitly disable it, set `enabled = false`. To remove the configuration entirely, omit this block. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--options--edge_cache_settings))
- `enable_ip_url_signing` (Boolean) Enable access limiting by IP addresses, option available only with setting secure_key.
- `fetched_compressed` (Boolean) Option helps you to reduce the bandwidth between origin and CDN servers. Also, content delivery speed becomes higher because of reducing the time for compressing files in a CDN.
- `forward_host_header` (Boolean) Choose the Forward Host header option if is important to send in the request to the Origin the same Host header as was sent in the request to CDN server.
- `gzip_on` (Boolean) GZip compression at CDN servers reduces file size by 70% and can be as high as 90%.
- `ignore_cookie` (Boolean) Set for ignoring cookie.
- `ignore_query_params` (Boolean) Files with different query parameters are cached as objects with the same key regardless of the parameter value. selected by default.
- `ip_address_acl` (Block List) IP address access control list. The list of specified IP addresses to be allowed or denied depending on acl policy type. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--options--ip_address_acl))
- `proxy_cache_methods_set` (Boolean) Allows caching for GET, HEAD and POST requests.
- `query_params_blacklist` (List of String) Files with the specified query parameters are cached as objects with the same key, files with other parameters are cached as objects with different keys.
- `query_params_whitelist` (List of String) Files with the specified query parameters are cached as objects with different keys, files with other parameters are cached as objects with the same key.
- `redirect_http_to_https` (Boolean) Set up a redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.
- `redirect_https_to_http` (Boolean) Set up a redirect from HTTPS to HTTP.
- `rewrite` (Block List) An option for changing or redirecting query paths. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--options--rewrite))
- `secure_key` (String, Sensitive) Set secure key for url encoding to protect content and limit access by IP addresses and time limits.
- `slice` (Boolean) Files larger than 10 MB will be requested and cached in parts (no larger than 10 MB each part). It reduces time to first byte. The origin must support HTTP Range requests.
- `static_request_headers` (Map of String) Set up custom headers that CDN servers will send in requests to origins.
- `static_response_headers` (Map of String) Set up a static response header. The header name must be lowercase.

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```bash
# terraform import yandex_cdn_resource.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_cdn_resource.my_cdn_resource ...
```
