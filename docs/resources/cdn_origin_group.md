# yandex_cdn_origin_group (Resource)

Allows management of [Yandex Cloud CDN Origin Groups](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cdn/concepts/origins).

~> **Note:** CDN provider must be activated prior usage of CDN resources, either via UI console or via yc cli command: `yc cdn provider activate --folder-id <folder-id> --type gcore`.

~> **Note:** Yandex Cloud CDN supports multiple CDN providers: Yandex Cloud CDN (based on Yandex own technology, used by default) and EdgeCDN (based on EdgeCenter infrastructure). The provider is automatically assigned when creating an origin group and cannot be changed.

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new CDN Origin Group
//
resource "yandex_cdn_origin_group" "my_group" {
  name     = "My Origin group"
  use_next = true

  origin {
    source = "ya.ru"
  }

  origin {
    source = "yandex.ru"
  }

  origin {
    source = "goo.gl"
  }

  origin {
    source = "amazon.com"
    backup = false
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The resource name.
- `origin` (Block Set, Min: 1) A set of available origins, an origins group must contain at least one enabled origin with fields below. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--origin))

### Optional

- `folder_id` (String) The folder identifier that resource belongs to. If it is not provided, the default provider `folder-id` is used.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `use_next` (Boolean) If the option is active (has true value), in case the origin responds with 4XX or 5XX codes, use the next origin from the list.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--origin"></a>
### Nested Schema for `origin`

Required:

- `source` (String) IP address or Domain name of your origin and the port.

Optional:

- `backup` (Boolean) Specifies whether the origin is used in its origin group as backup. A backup origin is used when one of active origins becomes unavailable.
- `enabled` (Boolean) The origin is enabled and used as a source for the CDN. Default `enabled`.

Read-Only:

- `origin_group_id` (Number) The ID of a specific origin group.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```bash
# terraform import yandex_cdn_origin_group.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_cdn_origin_group.my_cdn_group ...
```
