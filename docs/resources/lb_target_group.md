# yandex_lb_target_group (Resource)

A TargetGroup resource. For more information, see [Target groups and resources](/docs/network-load-balancer/concepts/target-resources).

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new NLB Target Group.
//
resource "yandex_lb_target_group" "my_tg" {
  name      = "my-target-group"
  region_id = "ru-central1"

  target {
    subnet_id = yandex_vpc_subnet.my-subnet.id
    address   = yandex_compute_instance.my-instance-1.network_interface.0.ip_address
  }

  target {
    subnet_id = yandex_vpc_subnet.my-subnet.id
    address   = yandex_compute_instance.my-instance-2.network_interface.0.ip_address
  }
}

- `name` (String) Name of the target group.
 The name is unique within the folder. 3-63 characters long.
- `region_id` (String) ID of the region where the target group resides.
- `target` (Block Set) A list of targets in the target group. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--target))
- `target_group_id` (String) ID of the TargetGroup resource to return.
 To get the target group ID, use a [TargetGroupService.List] request.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Output only. Creation timestamp in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```shell
# terraform import yandex_lb_target_group.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_lb_target_group.my_tg ...
```
